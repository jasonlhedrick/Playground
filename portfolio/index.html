                <p>Hello my name is Jason. And I don't know what to type. I don't have much practice in saying good things about myself.
                    I don't have a lot of understanding about the deep innerworkings of my motivations.
                    There are a lot of things I just don't understand about myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eventual point of this site is to be my portfolio. For now it's for me to spend time practicing.
                    Practicing my writing about myself.
                    Practicing my writing code.
                    Practice. Practice. Practice.
                    Repeat, repeat, repeat.
                    Practice and repeat and practice.
                    Over and over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who am I?
                    Who am I?
                    Patience.
                    Patience.
                    Patience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that repetition is the key to achieving anything.
                    I understand that I can learn without striving because the learning is not something I can actually do.
                    Learning is not something that I can achieve.
                    All I can do is practice and hope and pray that eventually an understanding will sink in.
                    So what's the best thing for it?
                    Just repeat
                    and repeat. and repeat again and again and again over and over and over until eventually it becomes one with yourself.

                <p>USE YOUR BRAIN.... THINK</p>
                <p>Have love for yourself. Do what you need to do to develop this.</p>
                <p>You have senses. You can use your eyes to look and see!
                    You can use your ears to listen to your surroundings.
                    You can use your touch to feel things around you.
                    You can smell the air nearby.

                    HTMl is a collection of tags which you use to describe the structure of a web page's content.
                    So what does this mean?
                    You have some form of content.
                    Writing, Video, Audio.
                    HTML describes the structure of how this content should be consumed.
                    HTML was based off how print newspapers and books where laid out.
                    HTML is based off the the top->down. Left->right writing structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML has a default look to it but is not designed to be used for designing
                    how the elements on your page look. 
                    HTML only cares about the structure of the page.
                    CSS concerns itself with the design of the page.
                    JavaScript concerns itself with the logic of the page.
